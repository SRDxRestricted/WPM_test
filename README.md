1. The program displays a sample text that the user has to type.
2. The user types the text and presses Enter when done.
3. The program calculates:
   - **Typing speed (WPM)** based on the time taken and the number of words typed.
   - **Accuracy**, by comparing the typed text with the original text.
4. Results are displayed on the screen.
